## 1. Project Architecture

This project aims to be compatible with AltStore / SideStore / LiveContainer. Its core functionality is to automatically fetch GitHub Releases via Python scripts and generate source files that meet the standards.

### 1.1 Core Directory Structure (Main Branch)

The `main` branch serves as the development source. It does **NOT** directly contain the deployable website root files.

```

### 1.2 Deployment Directory Structure (gh-pages Branch)

The `gh-pages` branch is an **orphan branch** (automatically constructed by CI). It is the actual content served by GitHub Pages.
**DO NOT** modify this branch manually.

The deployment structure is a flattened version of `main`:
1.  **Website Root**: Contents of `website/` are moved to the root.
2.  **Data Sources**: `sources/` directory is preserved to ensure stable data paths (e.g., `./sources/standard/source.json`).
3.  **Documentation**: `APPS.md` is copied to the root for easy access.

```
. (Root)
├── index.html                  # [WEB] Entry point (from website/)
├── css/                        # [STYLE] Stylesheets
├── js/                         # [LOGIC] Frontend modules & config
├── sources/                    # [DATA] JSON Data Sources (Preserved structure)
└── APPS.md                     # [DOCS] Generated App List
```

### 1.3 Key Configuration Files

*   **apps.json (`sources/standard/`, `sources/nsfw/`)**:
    *   The data source of the project.
    *   **Must include**: `name`, `github_repo` (Format: `Owner/Repo`).
    *   **Optional**: 
        *   `icon_url`, `tint_color` (Must be hex code `#RRGGBB`).
        *   `ipa_regex`: A regular expression to select a specific IPA from GitHub Releases.
        *   `pre_release`: Boolean (default: `false`). Set to `true` to prefer pre-releases/nightly versions.
        *   `tag_regex`: A regular expression to filter releases by their tag name.
        *   `github_workflow`: (New) Workflow file name (e.g., `nightly.yml`) to fetch IPAs from GitHub Actions Artifacts.
        *   `artifact_name`: (New) Regular expression to match the desired artifact name.
        *   `bundle_id`: (Auto-Sync) App's bundle identifier. Automatically extracted from IPA and synced back to `apps.json`.
    *   **Advanced Logic**:
        *   **Fast Skip**: The script detects if `downloadURL` (Release/Artifact) is unchanged. If unchanged AND the app entry in `apps.json` (name/icon) hasn't changed, it skips heavy processing (scraping & downloading).
        *   **Metadata Auto-Sync**: Fields like `icon_url` and `bundle_id` discovered by the script are automatically written back to `apps.json` to speed up future runs and improve data completeness.
        *   **Artifact Selection Heuristic**: When searching inside GitHub Artifacts (ZIP), the script follows a 6-step heuristic:
            1. **Exact Name Match**: Matches `artifact_name` from config.
            2. **IPA Suffix**: Looks for files ending in `.ipa`.
            3. **Keyword Search**: Looks for "ipa", "ios", or "app" in artifact names.
            4. **Exclusion Filter**: Removes artifacts containing "log", "symbol", "test", "debug", etc.
            5. **IPA Repackaging**: If only a `.app` folder is found, the script automatically packages it into a standard `.ipa` (Payload/ structure).
            6. **Ultimate Fallback**: Uses the first available artifact if all else fails.
        *   **App-Artifacts Hosting**: 
            *   **Direct Link Generation**: Instead of relying solely on `nightly.link` (which often returns 404s or ZIPs), the script now downloads artifacts via official GitHub API, repacks them if needed, and uploads them to a dedicated local release (`app-artifacts`).
            *   **Compatibility**: This provides standard IPA direct download links (`browser_download_url`), ensuring 100% compatibility with tools like LiveContainer and SideStore.
            *   **Maintenance**: Old assets in the `app-artifacts` release are automatically deleted before uploading new ones to save space and prevent confusion.
            *   **Nightly.link (Smart Proxy)**: If the primary GitHub API download fails, the script falls back to `nightly.link`. Crucially, it now **unpacks the ZIP, extracts the IPA, and re-hosts it** on `app-artifacts`, ensuring the final user always receives a direct IPA link regardless of the source.
    *   **Note**: Multiple entries for the same repository are allowed as long as their `name` is unique (e.g., "UTM" and "UTM (TrollStore)").
*   **deploy.yml (`.github/workflows/`)**:
    *   Responsible for assembling the website and source files and pushing them to the `gh-pages` branch.
    *   Triggered by `push` to `main` or completion of update/process workflows.

### 1.4 Dependency Management

This project mainly depends on the Python environment, and dependencies are defined in the CI workflow (see `.github/workflows/update.yml`).

*   **Python Version**: 3.x
*   **Core Libraries**:
    *   `requests`: Network requests
    *   `Pillow`: Image processing (extracting icon dominant color)
    *   `urllib3`: Handling retry logic

### 1.5 Frontend Features

*   **Dynamic Theming**: App cards extract dominant colors or use `tint_color` from `apps.json` to generate glow effects and button colors.
*   **Easter Egg System**:
    *   Triggered by rapidly clicking the status dot (footer) multiple times.
    *   **Sequence**: `triggerElementEater` (Intro animation, footer turns red and vanishes) -> `triggerConfetti` (Random visual effect like Matrix Rain or Pong) -> Auto Cleanup.
    *   **Debug Console**: Accessed by typing `debug` in the search bar. Allows manual triggering of individual effects for testing.

## 2. Strict Maintenance Process

### 2.1 Code Modification Guidelines

1.  **Branch Management**:
    *   **`main` Branch**: Contains source code, scripts, and documentation.
    *   **`gh-pages` Branch**: Strictly for deployment artifacts. **DO NOT** commit directly to `gh-pages`. It is forcefully overwritten by CI.
2.  **Validation Requirements**:
    *   **Logic Changes**: After modifying Python scripts, they must be simulated locally to ensure no errors.
    *   **Configuration Changes**: After modifying `apps.json`, the validation script must be run:
        ```bash
        python .github/scripts/validate_apps.py
        ```
3.  **Pre-commit Checks**:
    *   Run the complete local testing process.
    *   Ensure clean code formatting and remove unnecessary debug prints.

### 2.2 Change Control

*   **⚠️ No Direct Pushes**: All code changes must be merged via Pull Request (PR).
*   **Code Review**: PRs require at least one self-review (or peer review) to confirm no logical loopholes.

---

## 3. AI Collaboration Guidelines

This section is designed for AI coding assistants (e.g., Trae, Copilot, etc.). Please execute strictly.

### ⚠️ AI Specific Warnings

*   **Local Validation**: All generated Python code or JSON modifications **must** be verified by running validation tools in the local environment first before suggesting submission to the user.
*   **No Auto-Operations**: AI is **absolutely forbidden** from automatically executing `git commit` or `git push` commands.
*   **Permission First**: AI shall **NOT** ask or suggest to commit/push changes unless the user has explicitly requested it or the current task clearly implies deployment/release. Do not prompt for git operations in standard coding/debugging tasks.
*   **Debug Ports**: If a local server needs to be started (e.g., testing `website/index.html`), the port number must be explicitly informed to the user (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
*   **Web Interface Testing**:
    *   **MANDATORY**: For ANY website-related change (HTML/CSS/JS/Assets), regardless of size, you **MUST** launch a local server (`python3 -m http.server`) to verify.
    *   Provide the preview link (`http://localhost:8000`) to the user.
    *   Verify responsiveness, console logs, and network requests before confirming completion.

### AI Operation Log Requirements

When assisting with debugging or maintenance, AI should:
1.  **Record Commands**: Clearly list all shell commands attempted.
2.  **Preserve Output**: Keep copies of key error messages or script outputs in the conversation for backtracking.

### Documentation Refactoring Guidelines

When the AI is requested to refactor or update core documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`):

1.  **Trigger Condition**: Explicit user request to organize, translate, or improve documentation structure.
2.  **Standards**:
    *   **Consistency**: Ensure terminology aligns with `MAINTENANCE.md` (e.g., directory names, script roles).
    *   **Accuracy**: Verify all links (e.g., to `APPS.md` or `sources/standard/apps.json`) are valid.
    *   **Clarity**: Use standard Markdown, clear headings, and concise language.
3.  **Scope**:
    *   AI is authorized to modify text, formatting, and structure.
    *   **Prohibited**: Changing core project configuration links or deleting copyright notices without permission.
4.  **Verification**:
    *   Preview the rendered Markdown to ensure tables and badges display correctly.
    *   Check for broken links relative to the project root.

## 4. Deployment Process

### 4.1 Website and Source Release

This project uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages for automated deployment.

*   **Trigger Mechanism**:
    *   `deploy.yml`: The central deployment workflow. It triggers on:
        *   Push to `main`.
        *   Completion of `Process App Request` (Issue processing).
        *   Completion of `Update Source` (Scheduled updates).
*   **Release Architecture**:
    *   **Source (`main`)**: Clean development environment. Website assets are stored in `website/`.
    *   **Deployment (`gh-pages`)**: 
        *   An **Orphan Branch** (no history shared with main).
        *   Constructed dynamically by CI.
        *   **Content**:
            *   Files from `website/` -> Moved to root.
            *   Files from `sources/standard/` & `sources/nsfw/` -> Copied to `sources/` directory.
            *   `APPS.md` -> Copied to root.
    *   **GitHub Pages Configuration**: Must be set to build from the **`gh-pages`** branch.
    *   **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not edit files on `gh-pages` manually. They will be overwritten. Edit files in `website/` on `main` instead.

### 4.2 Test Requirements

*   **End-to-End Test (E2E)**:
    *   Before major logic changes (e.g., modifying IPA parsing logic), `update_source.py` must be manually triggered to run through a complete process.
*   **Log Retention**:
    *   GitHub Actions run logs are key for troubleshooting. Immediately download logs for analysis upon deployment failure.
*   **Documentation Auto-Update**:
    *   `APPS.md` is automatically regenerated during the update process. It includes a "Last Updated" timestamp and individual app update dates. Do not manually edit this file.

## 5. Emergency Response Plan

### 5.1 Problem Diagnosis

| Phenomenon | Possible Cause | Troubleshooting Scheme |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CI Run Failed** | API Rate Limit / Network Fluctuation | Check `429 Too Many Requests` or timeout errors in Actions logs. Usually retries automatically. |
| **Source File Empty/Corrupt** | JSON Format Error / Script Exception | Check local `apps.json` format; Rollback recent commit. |
| **App Not Updating** | Repo No Release / No IPA | Check if the target GitHub repo has a published Release containing `.ipa` files. |
| **Validation Failed** | Missing Fields / Duplicate Addition | Run `python .github/scripts/validate_apps.py` to locate specific lines. |
| **Deployment Failed (gh-pages)** | Git Conflict / Missing Files | Check `deploy.yml` logs. Ensure `website/` directory exists and contains index.html. |

### 5.2 Rollback Mechanism

In case of severe failure (e.g., generating a corrupted source.json causing client crashes):

1.  **Pause Auto-Update**:
    *   Disable `Update Source` workflow in GitHub Actions page.
2.  **Version Snapshot Rollback**:
    *   Find the last normal Commit ID.
    *   Execute rollback operations:
        ```bash
        git checkout main
        git revert HEAD  # Revert the last commit
        # Or reset to specific commit (Use with caution)
        # git reset --hard <commit-id> && git push --force
        ```
3.  **Restore Service**:
    *   Confirm the `source.json` format is correct after rollback.
    *   Re-enable GitHub Actions.
